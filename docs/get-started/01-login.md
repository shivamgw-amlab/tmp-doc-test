The [PuzzleMe Dashboard](https://amuselabs.com/pmm/dashboard) is the interface that enables you to create and manage all your puzzles. It contains 3 sections:
1. **Navigation Bar:** Located at the top of the page. This contains links to commonly used resources and actions.
2. **Series Panel:** This will contain information and actions relating to the current Series. For now, you can simply understand a Series as a kind of folder inside which you'll create your puzzles. 
3. **Puzzle Panel**: This will contain a list of all the puzzles that are in your current Series, along with some information and actions relating to those puzzles.

:::note[Info]
PuzzleMe Series are a fantastic tool for managing, organising, and publishing the puzzles that you create on our platform. You can find out more about them [here](tbd_terminology_series).
