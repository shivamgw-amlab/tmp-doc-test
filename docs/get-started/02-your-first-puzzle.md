# Creating a Puzzle
:::note[Objectives]

- Create your first puzzle.

:::

Now that you're familiar with the PuzzleMe Dashboard, you're ready to create your first puzzle: **a 10-word crossword**.


## Preparation
Crosswords often center around a single theme. Before we start, we encourage you to think of a theme (such as cars, history, geography, films), and to write down 10 words related to it!


## Steps
:::info
As you move through this tutorial, you'll find several elements of the interface that we haven't mentioned here. That's for good reason: this tutorial is to show you how you can get a fully functioning puzzle with little effort.
